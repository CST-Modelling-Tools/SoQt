This file contains a history log of user-visible changes in the SoQt
library.

* 2000-06-26 larsa:
	SoQt has now support for the Linux Joystick driver, which means
	you can connect e.g. a Spaceball 4000 FLX to your serial port
	and get Motion3/SpaceballButton events sent into the scene graph.
	See http://www.suse.cz/development/joystick/ for information on
	the driver.
