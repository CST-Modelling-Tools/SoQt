000 Adding an app-specific pushbutton to the SoQtExaminerViewer will
    make the left border too thin. Reproduce with this code:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtExaminerViewer.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoCone.h>
    #include <qpushbutton.h>
    
    
    int
    main(int argc,  char ** argv)
    {
      QWidget * window = SoQt::init("");
    
      SoQtExaminerViewer * examinerviewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer(window);
      examinerviewer->setSceneGraph(new SoCone);
    
      QWidget * parent = examinerviewer->getAppPushButtonParent();
      QPushButton * button = new QPushButton(parent);
      examinerviewer->addAppPushButton(button);
    
      examinerviewer->show();
      SoQt::show(window);
      SoQt::mainLoop();
    
      delete examinerviewer;
      return 0;
    } 
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    I see at least two problems in the SoQtFullViewer::buildLeftTrim()
    code: 1) it is always set to a fixed width of 30 pixels, 2) it is
    not size-updated when buttons are added.

002 The following example demonstrates a bug with how the Qt widgets
    seems to be stacked when we call SoQtComponent::show():

    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtViewer.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoCone.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>
    #include <qapplication.h>
    #include <qwidget.h>
    
    
    class NewViewer : public SoQtViewer {
    public:
      NewViewer(QWidget * parent)
        : SoQtViewer(parent, "buh", FALSE, SoQtViewer::BROWSER, FALSE)
      {
        QWidget * widget = this->buildWidget(parent);
        this->setBaseWidget(widget);
    
        SoSeparator * root = new SoSeparator;
        root->addChild(new SoCone);
        this->setSceneGraph(root);
    
        // FIXME: this causes the bug, remove the next line and all is
        // well. 20020619 mortene.
        this->show();
      }
    };
    
    int
    main(int argc, char ** argv)
    {
      QWidget * qw = SoQt::init(argv[0]);
      NewViewer * svapp = new NewViewer(qw);
      SoQt::show(qw);
      SoQt::mainLoop();
      return 0;
    }

003 Animations that are continually triggered by timer-sensors are not
    running as smooth in Coin's viewers as with SGI Inventor. This
    makes it looks like Coin has worse rendering performance than SGI
    Inventor.

    It also looks like we have the same problem in SoXt.

    Part of the problem, at least, seems to be that it is possible to
    get several actualRedraw() calls in-between the handling of native
    Qt events. That causes for instance SoQtExaminerViewer's
    invocations of spin() to happen more seldom than actualRedraw(),
    which again causes bad responsiveness.

    This is not a trivial task.

004 When turning on decorations (use the RMB popup-menu to do this)
    with a small viewer window, the decorations layout will initially
    be erroneous. Just a small interactive resize in any direction
    will automatically correct the layout again.

    Found by kintel. Looks like a Qt bug. Very low priority on fixing
    this one, as it's just a very small blemish in a boundary-kind-of
    condition anyway.

      viewer->setSceneGraph(new SoCone);
      viewer->setDecoration(FALSE);
    
      viewer->show();
      SoQt::show(window);
    
      window->resize(100, 100);
    
      SoQt::mainLoop();
    
      delete viewer;
      return 0;
    }

005 Using SoQtComponent::setSize() to set a smaller size than the
    default _after_ doing either SoQtExaminerViewer::show() or
    SoQt::show(SoQtExaminerViewer*) fails, at least for an
    SoQtExaminerViewer embedded in a top-level shell (like in the
    SoGuiExamples/components/examinerviewer example.

    The interior resizes correctly (?), but the exterior does not
    shrink to fit.
