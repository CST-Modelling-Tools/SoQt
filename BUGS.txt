000 Adding an app-specific pushbutton to the SoQtExaminerViewer will
    make the left border too thin. Reproduce with this code:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtExaminerViewer.h>

    #include <qpushbutton.h>
    
    
    int
    main(int argc,  char ** argv)
    {
      QWidget * window = SoQt::init("");
    
      SoQtExaminerViewer * examinerviewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer(window);
      examinerviewer->setSceneGraph(new SoCone);
    
      QWidget * parent = examinerviewer->getAppPushButtonParent();
      QPushButton * button = new QPushButton(parent);
      examinerviewer->addAppPushButton(button);
    
      examinerviewer->show();
      SoQt::show(window);
      SoQt::mainLoop();
    
      delete examinerviewer;
      return 0;
    } 
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    I see at least two problems in the SoQtFullViewer::buildLeftTrim()
    code: 1) it is always set to a fixed width of 30 pixels, 2) it is
    not size-updated when buttons are added.

002 The following example demonstrates a bug with how the Qt widgets
    seems to be stacked when we call SoQtComponent::show():

    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtViewer.h>

    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>
    #include <qapplication.h>
    #include <qwidget.h>
    
    
    class NewViewer : public SoQtViewer {
    public:
      NewViewer(QWidget * parent)
        : SoQtViewer(parent, "buh", FALSE, SoQtViewer::BROWSER, FALSE)
      {
        QWidget * widget = this->buildWidget(parent);
        this->setBaseWidget(widget);
    
        SoSeparator * root = new SoSeparator;
        root->addChild(new SoCone);
        this->setSceneGraph(root);
    
        // FIXME: this causes the bug, remove the next line and all is
        // well. 20020619 mortene.
        this->show();
      }
    };
    
    int
    main(int argc, char ** argv)
    {
      QWidget * qw = SoQt::init(argv[0]);
      NewViewer * svapp = new NewViewer(qw);
      SoQt::show(qw);
      SoQt::mainLoop();
      return 0;
    }

    UPDATE: Not seeing the scene-graph displayed in the main window in
    the above example is actually correct behavior: Note the FALSE
    flag passed on for 'embed'. The fact that the scene-graph is
    displayed when removing 'this->show()' is the actual bug... :-) A
    quick check (SoQT/test_code/renderarea.cpp) shows that
    SoQtRenderArea does the correct thing when passed a FALSE: It is
    built outside of the application window. On the other hand, when
    the widget is passed 'TRUE' for 'embed', in the code displayed
    above, it works as expected. 20021023 rolvs

003 Animations that are continually triggered by timer-sensors are not
    running as smooth in Coin's viewers as with SGI Inventor. This
    makes it looks like Coin has worse rendering performance than SGI
    Inventor.

    It also looks like we have the same problem in SoXt.

    Part of the problem, at least, seems to be that it is possible to
    get several actualRedraw() calls in-between the handling of native
    Qt events. That causes for instance SoQtExaminerViewer's
    invocations of spin() to happen more seldom than actualRedraw(),
    which again causes bad responsiveness.

    This is not a trivial task.

004 When turning on decorations (use the RMB popup-menu to do this)
    with a small viewer window, the decorations layout will initially
    be erroneous. Just a small interactive resize in any direction
    will automatically correct the layout again.

    Found by kintel. Looks like a Qt bug. Very low priority on fixing
    this one, as it's just a very small blemish in a boundary-kind-of
    condition anyway.

005 Using SoQtComponent::setSize() to set a smaller size than the
    default _after_ doing either SoQtExaminerViewer::show() or
    SoQt::show(SoQtExaminerViewer*) fails, at least for an
    SoQtExaminerViewer embedded in a top-level shell (like in the
    SoGuiExamples/components/examinerviewer example.

    The interior resizes correctly (?), but the exterior does not
    shrink to fit.

007 We have a problem report from Radu Ursu on coin-discuss on using
    SoQt with a static Qt library, built with Microsoft Visual C++ v7:
    if Qt is added to the link-line for the final executable, it seems
    like two different Qt-instances are used. If not, there's a lot of
    complaints about missing symbols.

    Investigate with VC6 and see if it's the same there. If not, try
    to resolve when we install VC7.

009 Michael Wimmer reported that using SoQt on top of SGI Inventor
    causes one particular scene he had to run veeeeeery slow, both
    compared to SoQt-on-Coin and InventorXt-on-Inventor.

    The scene consists of some very simple geometry and 11
    textures. The textures are in total shared > 1000 times in the
    scene, though.

    (I could reproduce the problem with Wimmer's example model file,
    but it was too large (lots if inlined textures) to cut down on and
    include here.)

    It seems likely that the bad rendering performance is caused by
    continuous re-construction and re-destruction of GL texture
    objects. According to pederb, SGI Inventor has a bug here which
    has since been fixed by TGS.

    Should a) construct a scene which reproduces the problem, b)
    investigate how we set up cache context IDs for the
    SoGLRenderAction instance in SoQt and determine what causes SGI
    Inventor to completely flip out, c) try to find a work-around.

012 Error with SoQtExaminerViewer::getViewerTitle().

    A bug-report from Paul van Santen of Hitec-O:

         It seems that this method now returns an empty string, even
         though we have set the title in the class' constructor. Is
         this a bug or an intended code change?

    Not yet investigated, but sounds very likely to be a bug.

    After fixing, make sure the different possible "configurations" of
    an SoQtExaminerViewer component in a Qt component-ownership tree
    is tested to work: both SoQtExaminerViewer as a top-level window,
    and embedded in an application Qt widget.

    UPDATE: I've tried to recreate this bug by creating QMainWindow
    with an embedded ExaminerViewer, and fetching the title of the
    viewer after initialization. This does not demonstrate the
    erroneous behaviour, and the demo application is sent to Paul van
    Santen. Awaiting reply from him. 20021022 rolvs.

013 Minor user-interaction bug with the SoQtExaminerViewer.

    The camera-interaction mode can "get stuck" in this manner: click
    and drag the model. While still holding the LMB, hit 'ESC' to
    switch to scenegraph-interaction mode. Let go of LMB. Hit 'ESC'
    again. You're now in "drag/examine"-mode even though you're not
    holding down the LMB.

    (Simple to work around for the user -- just hit 'ESC' twice -- but
    it's still an irritating bug.)

    This bug is very likely common for all the So@Gui@ toolkits.

014 Viewers don't resize when the decorations isn't built. 

    When trying to construct any one of the *Fly*, *Examiner* and
    *PlaneViewers with either of the flags SoQtFullViewer::BUILD_NONE
    or SoQtFullViewer::BUILD_POPUP, the canvas fails to resize to any
    apropriate size (It displays sa a small window in the corner).
    
    Minimal example that demonstrates this: 
    
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    
    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <qapplication.h>

    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtExaminerViewer.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoCone.h>
    #include <qwidget.h>

    int main(int argc, char ** argv)
    {
        QWidget * window = SoQt::init(argc, argv, argv[0]);
  
        SoQtExaminerViewer * viewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer
            (window, "Examiner Viewer" ,TRUE,
            SoQtFullViewer::BUILD_NONE);

        viewer->setSceneGraph(new SoCone);
        viewer->show();

        SoQt::show(window);  
        window->resize(500, 500);
  
        SoQt::mainLoop();
        return 0;
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    On the other hand, if the viewer is built first /with/ decorations
    and then followed by a call to setDecoration( FALSE ) it works as
    expected. Then again, if the embed-flag is set to false on
    construction, it performs as expected. As it applies to all
    viewers, the source of this bug is probably found in
    SoQtFullViewer.

    First reported by Daniel Soto.

    UPDATE: Should be fixed now. Building the decorations, and then
    hiding them if they aren't needed makes this failure go away, as
    well as an assert-bailout reported by Tamer Fahmy. 20021022 rolvs
