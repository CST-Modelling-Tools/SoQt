SoQtSuperViewer, experimental
2002-05-07 larsivi

The files in this directory together makes the SoQtSuperViewer,
a reimplementation of the VRML-viewer using Coin. The viewer
is not completed, but most of the functionality should be there.
The viewer will be completed ASAP (not necessarily tomorrow).

This viewer is currently only a Qt project and has only been
tested on Windows (as far as larsivi knows).

SuperViewer.cpp is included so it is possible to get an application
up and running. It works quite nice on its own. It has not been
tested for embedding yet.

The SuperViewer can be built using soqt-config

Please report bugs and any good ideas for new functionality.

There are couple of known bugs which are listed below.

Cannot be completed without changes in the Coin-API:
 * Flatshading (if there are normals, its not flatshaded)
 * Some text manipulation in the menus and in the window caption
     will be easier whenever a commited patch for SbString is 
     inserted into the API. If its not used, it will be done
     in other ways. This problem may also affect the refresh
     functionality and the snapshot function.
 * There are some problems with including the config.h which are
     caused the lack of a real
     Hopefully these will be solved soon.

 NB! At the moment, the SuperViewer uses Coin-1 and Qt 2.3.0.
     Also, SuperViewer isn't necessarily the final name since
     it is just a little bit ambigous.

Included files:
SoQtSuperViewer.cpp //The main source file

                         // and signals in Qt to work
                         //This file will be updated when needed
