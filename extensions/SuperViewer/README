SoQtSuperViewer, experimental
2002-05-24 larsivi

The files in this directory together makes the SoQtSuperViewer,
a reimplementation of the VRML-viewer using Coin. The viewer
is not completed, but most of the functionality should be there.
The viewer will be completed ASAP (not necessarily tomorrow).

This viewer is currently only a Qt project and has only been
tested on Windows (as far as larsivi knows).

SuperViewer.cpp is included so it is possible to get an application
up and running. It works quite nice on its own. It has not been
tested for embedding yet.

The SuperViewer can be built using soqt-config

Please report bugs and any good ideas for new functionality.

There are couple of known bugs which are listed below.

 * There are some problems with including the config.h which are
     caused by the lack of a real build system.
     Hopefully these will be solved soon.
 * The fly mode doesn't work satisfactory.
 * Its impossible to get the model to spin for now. Bug was
     introduced as a millisecond overflow problem was fixed.

     At the moment, the SuperViewer is developed against Qt 2.3.0,
     but it is reported to compile correctly against Qt 3.0.0 too. 
     It is possible to build it against Coin-1 with minor 
     modifications, though with time this will become a more laborous 
     option, since more and more extensions in Coin-2 will be used.
     Also, SuperViewer isn't necessarily the final name since
     it is just a little bit ambigous.

Included files:
SoQtSuperViewer.cpp //The main source file
SoQtSuperViewer.h   //The main header file
SoQtSuperViewerP.h  //Header file for private data and methods
SoQtSuperViewerP.cpp  //The code for the private methods, including
                      //some static stuff
moc_SoQtSuperViewerP.icc  //The file needed to get the slots
                         // and signals in Qt to work
                         //This file will be updated when needed
SuperViewer.cpp  //The testbed with the main()-method
