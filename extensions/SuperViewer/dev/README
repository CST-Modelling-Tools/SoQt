SuperViewer/dev
larsivi 20020606

This directory holds the next generation SuperViewer. Though the original
works fine, the internal organization wasn't good enough.

This is an effort to split GUI from functionality, and the first part of
this is the SuperCanvas that has all of the functional API, but none visual 
GUI stuff. The SuperCanvas is almost totally GUI-generic and can be built to 
use all of the So*-libraries given that buildWidget is implemented for all
of them.

As it is now, there is much that is not tested.
As an alternative to RenderArea, the SuperCanvas can offer mousecontrolled
interactions with the scenegraph (rotation, panning, zooming++). The untested
functionality adds more flexibility.

Known bugs:
 
  * ONE_BBOX_WM doesn't work.
