This file describes some hacking techniques that are particular
for the Open Inventor GUI toolkit family.

Finding Component Information
=============================

  We have added some easter eggs to the debug versions of the
  GUI toolkit libraries that can be used to find information
  about which components are in use.

  Typing 'glinfo' in a SoQt viewer will make SoQt probe all kinds
  of information from the GL driver and open a window displaying
  it.

  Typing 'ivinfo' in a SoQt viewer will make SoQt probe information
  about the underlying Open Inventor implementation and display
  it in a new window.  The amount of information is not that great
  yet.

  Typing 'soinfo' in a SoQt viewer will make SoQt open a window
  with some basic information about itself.
