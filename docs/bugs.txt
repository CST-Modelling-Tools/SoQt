000. SoQt over Qt2.0 has a number of irritating problems which doesn't show
     up with Qt1.x:
  a. decoration on/off doesn't make the scene gfx reposition/resize correctly
  b. should remove the focus indicator
  c. something is wrong with the drag->spin mechanism, looks like we get
     too few mouseposition events to get a good idea of where we are going
  d. we get too many redraw events on resizing the window

001. Quick LMB click in viewer window screws up interactive count
     (enable the debug code in SoQtViewer::interactiveCountInc() and
     SoQtViewer::interactiveCountDec() to see this one).

002. Resize so height > width -> aspectratio is not updated
     accordingly.

003. Cursorgfx in SoQtExaminerViewer has somehow become foobar -- to
     do with the mask manipulation in
     SoQtExaminerViewer::setCursorRepresentation()?

004. Start the SoQt/examples/examinerviewer example without any
     modelfile as argument, drag the left rotate wheel a bit up or
     down -- leads to major bounding box fuckups.

005. Pick/view togglebuttons doesn't work correctly:
     * clicking on a button already pressed down shouldn't have any effect
     * moving the cursor within the render canvas while in pick mode leads
       to an assertion failing

006. Switching buffer mode (from doublebuffer to singlebuffer, for
     instance) switches the cursor back to the standard cursor until
     we do any action within the window again.

007. Lighting is defunct in singlebuffer mode, and going back again to
     doublebuffer mode doesn't help (weird).

008. Interactivebuffer mode is foobar.

009. No support for overlay planes. Overlay planes can be done within
     Qt with a bit of hacking -- see the example in the Qt distro.

010. No support for stereo mode.

011. The thumbwheels looks pretty shoddy. Should fix both the general
     appearance and the animation gfx.

012. Something is wrong with the signal-slot mechanism set up in the
     preference window.

013. Need to set minimum size for some of the windows to avoid Qt
     bombing out on resizing to too small dimensions.
