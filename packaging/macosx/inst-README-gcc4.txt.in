This is SoQt-@VERSION@ by Systems in Motion. Double-click on SoQt.pkg
to start the installation. If you intend to develop without using 
Xcode, you should also install the SoQtTools package, which contains 
the soqt-config commandline utility, its associated man page, and 
its default configuration. 

If you do not want to use an installer, you can find a package 
containing only the framework itself on our ftp server[0] (look
for SoQt-@VERSION@-gcc4-no_inst.dmg).

SoQt is a GUI binding for Coin. For it to be useful, you will need to
install Coin (or another Open Inventor implementation). You can
download the Coin binary SDK from the ftp server.

Note that this binary SDK has been built with gcc 4.0, meaning that 
no earlier version of gcc should be used in combination with this
framework. Due to the ABI changes in gcc 4.0, applications built
against this framework can only be used on Mac OS 10.4 "Tiger" or 
Mac OS 10.3.9. If you need to deploy on earlier versions of Mac OS
X, use gcc 3.3 and the binary SDK of Coin and SoQt built with gcc 
3.3. For more information, please read the relevant FAQ entry at [1].

The Coin3D/Mac homepage[2] contains more information on how to get
started using Coin and SoQt. You might also want to consider
joining our public mailing list for discussions related to Coin3D 
development[3].

Enjoy!
