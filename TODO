ToDo
====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date] item", listed in no particular order)

*** BUILD ITEMS ***

* [larsa:20000201] change #ifndef/#define/#endif header-wrapper namespace

* [larsa:20000130] wrap SoQt-internal #include directives with #ifndef wrappers

* [mortene:19990917] write information in NEWS, README, HACKING,
  AUTHORS, COPYING.

* [mortene:19990917] write non-generic info in INSTALL.

* [mortene:19990918] add SOQT_MAJOR/MINOR/MICRO_VERSION etc somewhere
  in an include file (as in libCoin SbBasic.h).
  [larsa:20000130] "somewhere" => Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h

* [mortene:19990918] moc_*.cpp files should be removed when doing
  ``make clean''.

* [mortene:19990918] look into making some kind of suffix (or prefix?)
  make rule for moc targets (to minimalize mess in Makefile.am files).

* [mortene:19990923] having moc generating source files means
  cross-compilation will be harder. Basically, we'll need to generate
  moc for the host platform and build the other sources with the
  cross-compiler. Ugh. This is pretty low-priority now, though, as we
  haven't set up anything for cross-compilation yet.

* [mortene:19990919] integrate generation of man- and html-doc into
  the autoconf/automake-based build.



*** MISSING COMPONENTS ***

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtDirectionalLightEditor.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtPrintDialog.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtMaterialEditor.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtMaterialList.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtLightSliderSet.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtMaterialSliderSet.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtTransformSliderSet.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtResource?

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtClipboard.

* [larsa: 20000130] SoConstrainedViewer.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtFlyViewer.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtWalkViewer.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtCollisionViewer.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtSIMViewer (this is the good old VRMLview,
  converted to become an SoQt component).



*** BUGS ***

* [mortene:20000319] test-code/components/tripleview doesn't work when
  running on top of OIV -- only one of the render areas have any model
  graphic visualization.

* [larsa:20000130] the translation wheels in the plane viewer component
  are configured opposite of how it's done in OIV.  this was done on
  purpose, but I'm yet undecided on which way to configure the wheels.

* [mortene:19991111] seems like there's a problem with camera focal
  point and floating point precision, here's how to reproduce: load a
  scene containing only a sphere (other shapes or complex scene graphs
  will probably also do), start a spin, zoom it backwards _far_ away,
  zoom it back again.

* [mortene:1999????] something is wrong with the drag->spin mechanism,
  looks like we get too few mouseposition events to get a good idea of
  the spin direction.

* [mortene:1999????] need to set minimum size for some of the windows
   to avoid Qt bombing out on resizing to too small dimensions.

* [mortene:1999????] the geometry sometimes seems misaligned after
   resize operations.

* [mortene:1999????] resize so height > width -> aspectratio is not
  updated accordingly.

* [mortene:1999????] pick/view togglebuttons doesn't work correctly:
  clicking on a button already pressed down shouldn't have any effect.
  The best solution would probably be to toggle the button graphics,
  like we do on the ortho/perspective button?

* [mortene:1999????] switching buffer mode (from doublebuffer to
  singlebuffer, for instance) switches the cursor back to the standard
  cursor until we do any action within the window again.

* [mortene:1999????] lighting is defunct in singlebuffer mode, and
  going back again to doublebuffer mode doesn't help (weird).

* [mortene:1999????] interactivebuffer mode is fubar.

* [mortene:1999????] no support for overlay planes. Overlay planes can
  be done within Qt with a bit of hacking -- see the example in the Qt
  2 distro.

* [mortene:1999????] add the generic part of the support for stereo
  mode, if possible with Qt.

* [mortene:1999????] something is wrong with the signal-slot mechanism
  set up in the preference window.

* [mortene:20000319] fallback on the gl-code in SoPolygonOffsetElement
  for hidden line rendering in SoAnyViewer when the SoPolygonOffset
  node is not available.
