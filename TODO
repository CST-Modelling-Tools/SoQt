ToDo
====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date] item", listed in no particular order)

* [mortene:19990917] write information in NEWS, README, HACKING,
  AUTHORS, ChangeLog, COPYING.

* [mortene:19990917] write non-generic info in INSTALL.

* [mortene:19990918] use the OpenGL detection macro (and the resulting
  GL_CFLAGS and GL_LIBS)? Or is this taken care of with the linking
  against OpenGL (or Mesa) with libCoin?

* [mortene:19990918] add SOQT_MAJOR/MINOR/MICRO_VERSION etc somewhere
  in an include file (as in libCoin SbBasic.h).

* [mortene:19990918] moc_*.cpp files should be removed when doing
  ``make clean''.

* [mortene:19990918] look into making some kind of suffix (or prefix?)
  make rule for moc targets (to minimalize mess in Makefile.am files).

* [mortene:19990919] improve the detection and handling of Open
  Inventor dependency libraries in configure.in -- possibly also for
  other libraries we depend on (Qt, QGL). Ideally, we should make
  something which automatically works over multiple platforms
  (including Win32).

* [mortene:19990919] move the items in the buglist at docs/bugs.txt
  into this ToDo-list.

* [mortene:19990919] integrate generation of man- and html-doc into
  the autoconf/automake-based build.

* [mortene:19990919] use caching for some of the extra configuration
  checks we do to speed up invocations of configure.
