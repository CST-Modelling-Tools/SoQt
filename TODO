ToDo
====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date] item", listed in no particular order)

*** BUILD ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19990926] add configure option for specifying location of
  the Coin library.

* [mortene:19990929] remove all compiler warnings, set default
  configure settings to "warnings on".

* [mortene:19990917] write information in NEWS, README, HACKING,
  AUTHORS, ChangeLog, COPYING.

* [mortene:19990917] write non-generic info in INSTALL.

* [mortene:19990918] use the OpenGL detection macro (and the resulting
  GL_CFLAGS and GL_LIBS)? Or is this taken care of with the linking
  against OpenGL (or Mesa) with libCoin?

* [mortene:19990918] add SOQT_MAJOR/MINOR/MICRO_VERSION etc somewhere
  in an include file (as in libCoin SbBasic.h).

* [mortene:19990918] moc_*.cpp files should be removed when doing
  ``make clean''.

* [mortene:19990918] look into making some kind of suffix (or prefix?)
  make rule for moc targets (to minimalize mess in Makefile.am files).

* [mortene:19990923] having moc generating source files means
  cross-compilation will be harder. Basically, we'll need to generate
  moc for the host platform and build the other sources with the
  cross-compiler. Ugh. This is pretty low-priority now, though, as we
  haven't set up anything for cross-compilation yet.

* [mortene:19990919] improve the detection and handling of Open
  Inventor dependency libraries in configure.in -- possibly also for
  other libraries we depend on (Qt, QGL). Ideally, we should make
  something which automatically works over multiple platforms
  (including Win32).

* [mortene:19990919] move the items in the buglist at docs/bugs.txt
  into this ToDo-list.

* [mortene:19990919] integrate generation of man- and html-doc into
  the autoconf/automake-based build.

* [mortene:19990919] use caching for some of the extra configuration
  checks we do to speed up invocations of configure.



*** MISSING COMPONENTS ***

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtDirectionalLightEditor.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtPrintDialog.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtMaterialEditor.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtMaterialList.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtLightSliderSet.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtMaterialSliderSet.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtTransformSliderSet.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtResource?

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtClipboard.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtCollisionViewer.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtFlyViewer.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtWalkViewer.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtPlaneViewer.

* [mortene:19991001] SoQtSIMViewer (this is the good old VRMLview,
  converted to become an SoQt component).



*** BUGS ***

* [mortene:19991117] click seek, miss with the ray, click seek again
  -- mode is still "grab". Click seek again to into seek mode.

* [mortene:19991111] seems like there's a problem with camera focal
  point and floating point precision, here's how to reproduce: load a
  scene containing only a sphere (other shapes or complex scene graphs
  will probably also do), start a spin, zoom it backwards _far_ away,
  zoom it back again.

* [mortene:1999????] SoQt over Qt2.0 has a number of irritating
  problems which doesn't show up with Qt1.x:
   a. decoration on/off doesn't make the scene gfx reposition/resize
      correctly until further interaction
   b. should remove the focus indicator on the top-most right-row button
   c. something is wrong with the drag->spin mechanism, looks like we get
      too few mouseposition events to get a good idea of where we are going
   d. we get too many redraw events on resizing the window

* [mortene:1999????] resize so height > width -> aspectratio is not
  updated accordingly.

* [mortene:1999????] start the SoQt/examples/examinerviewer example
  without any modelfile as argument (to get one of the random shapes),
  drag the left rotate wheel a bit up or down -- leads to major
  rendering fuckups.

* [mortene:1999????] pick/view togglebuttons doesn't work correctly:
     * clicking on a button already pressed down shouldn't have any effect
     * moving the cursor within the render canvas while in pick mode leads
       to an assertion failing

* [mortene:1999????] switching buffer mode (from doublebuffer to
  singlebuffer, for instance) switches the cursor back to the standard
  cursor until we do any action within the window again.

* [mortene:1999????] lighting is defunct in singlebuffer mode, and
  going back again to doublebuffer mode doesn't help (weird).

* [mortene:1999????] interactivebuffer mode is foobar.

* [mortene:1999????] no support for overlay planes. Overlay planes can
  be done within Qt with a bit of hacking -- see the example in the Qt
  2 distro.

* [mortene:1999????] add the generic part of the support for stereo
  mode, if possible with Qt.

* [mortene:1999????] the thumbwheels looks pretty shoddy. Should fix
  both the general appearance and the animation gfx.

* [mortene:1999????] something is wrong with the signal-slot mechanism
  set up in the preference window.

* [mortene:1999????] need to set minimum size for some of the windows
  to avoid Qt bombing out on resizing to too small dimensions.

Done
====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date][implementer:finished-date] item")

* [mortene:1999????][mortene:19991001] quick LMB click in viewer
  window screws up interactive count (enable the debug code in
  SoQtViewer::interactiveCountInc() and
  SoQtViewer::interactiveCountDec() to see this one).

* [mortene:1999????][mortene:19990930] cursorgfx in SoQtExaminerViewer
  has somehow become foobar -- to do with the mask manipulation in
  SoQtExaminerViewer::setCursorRepresentation()?

* [mortene:19990924][mortene:19990926] check for Coin in the --prefix
  installation directory.

* [mortene:19990917][mortene:19990919] build QtThumbwheel test program.

* [mortene:19990917][mortene:19990919] build example program
  examples/examinerviewer/examinerviewer.

* [mortene:19990917][mortene:19990918] make a configure option for
  compiling over Open Inventor (from OIVHOME?).

* [mortene:19990917][mortene:19990918] include moc-invocation and
  moc-generated files in the build.

* [mortene:19990917][mortene:19990917] check for the moc binary.

* [mortene:19990917][mortene:19990918] check for the Qt library (under
  QTDIR).

* [mortene:19990917][mortene:19990918] check for the QGL library
  (under QTDIR).

* [mortene:19990917][mortene:19990918] check for the Coin library
  (under COINDIR?).
